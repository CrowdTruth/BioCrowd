It is very important to estimate the amount of troops the enemy has in that base.
In order to do this, you must count the amount of tents/buildings the enemy has built there. Be careful! The enemy has tried to hide their buildings by putting them in the awning of the walls. Good luck!</p>",Mark each building by clicking it or drawing a shape around it,I have annotated all buildings,There were too many buildings to annotate,There are no tents/buildings in this image,Other,Enter the total number of buildings here:,Click near the center of al visible buildings or drag the mouse to draw a box around the buildings. Keep a mental count while you are tagging.,Choose the option from the given list which best describes your building markings.,Report the number of buildings you have counted in the designated field. ,Click the button which best describes the given image quality.

Now we need to know the blueprint of their main building, where we will begin our assault. We have used a satellite with X-ray vision to see the walls of the building. <Example of a room> Put a marking on each room you see. Be careful! Some rooms might lie on top of other rooms and seem to overlap in the picture. Count these as two separate rooms. </p>",Mark each room by clicking it or drawing a shape around it,I have annotated all rooms,There were too many rooms to annotate,There are no rooms in this image,Other,Enter the total number of rooms here:,Click near the center of al visible rooms or drag the mouse to draw a box around the rooms.

,,,,,,,,,"Colony Catcher[[Colony tagging Template(entity/BioCrowd/batch/2, , )]]","<p>The blueprint you constructed in last assignment has given us a new insight: the people that are standing in the rooms can
be seen in the x-ray photos as well! This would give us an even more accurate count of the amount of enemies in the base.
<Example of an enemy head> Put a marking on each enemy you see. Be careful! Some enemies might seem to overlap since
they are on different stories of the building. Count these as two separate enemies. </p>
