In order to do this, you must count the amount of tents/buildings the enemy has built there. Be careful! The enemy has
tried to hide their buildings by putting them in the awning of the walls. Good luck!</p>",Mark each building by clicking it or drawing a shape around it,I have annotated all buildings,There were too many buildings to annotate,There are no tents/buildings in this image,Other,Enter the total number of buildings here:
,,,,,Nucleus tagging,"<p>The building count has given us a good sense of their numbers, well done. Now we need to know the blueprint of
their main building, where we will begin our assault. We have used a satellite with X-ray vision to see the
walls of the building. <Example of a room> Put a marking on each room you see. Be careful! Some rooms might lie
on top of other rooms and seem to overlap in the picture. Count these as two separate rooms. </p>",Mark each room by clicking it or drawing a shape around it,I have annotated all rooms,There were too many rooms to annotate,There are no rooms in this image,Other,Enter the total number of rooms here:
,,,,,Colony tagging,"<p>The blueprint you constructed in last assignment has given us a new insight: the people that are standing in the rooms can
be seen in the x-ray photos as well! This would give us an even more accurate count of the amount of enemies in the base.
<Example of an enemy head> Put a marking on each enemy you see. Be careful! Some enemies might seem to overlap since
they are on different stories of the building. Count these as two separate enemies. </p>

would like you to go over this marking document and add any enemies that haven\'t been marked yet and delete any
false markings. Keep in mind that we don\'t know who made the mistakes, so you might not find any mistakes! </p>",Mark each enemy by clicking it or drawing a shape around it,I have annotated all mistakes,There were too many mistakes to annotate,There are no mistakes in this image,Other,Enter the total number of enemies here:
